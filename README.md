# GUI_Commands_in_Linux
🗂️ 1. File Manager (e.g., Nautilus, Thunar)
GUI Action: When you copy, move, or delete files using the GUI file explorer.

What’s running behind the scenes:

bash
Copy
Edit
cp source.txt destination/      # copy
mv file.txt /path/              # move/rename
rm file.txt                     # delete
mkdir newfolder                 # create folder
The GUI just provides buttons and drag/drop — but the actual operations are carried out using these basic file management commands.



📝 2. Gedit (GNOME Text Editor)
GUI Action: When you open or edit a file with Gedit.

What’s running behind the scenes:

bash
Copy
Edit
gedit file.txt &                # open a text file
cat file.txt                    # read content
echo "Hello" >> file.txt        # append text
Gedit is the graphical equivalent of writing and editing files using commands like cat, echo, or nano.



🎬 3. VLC Media Player
GUI Action: When you open and play a media file using VLC.

What’s running behind the scenes:

bash
Copy
Edit
vlc video.mp4                   # open video file
cvlc video.mp4                  # terminal mode (no GUI)
Behind that Play button is simply the vlc command running the file — VLC can also be launched entirely via terminal.



🌐 4. Firefox Browser
GUI Action: When you open a website via Firefox.

What’s running behind the scenes:

bash
Copy
Edit
firefox https://google.com      # open URL in browser
curl https://google.com         # terminal-based version
The GUI browser loads the page, but technically you can do the same via terminal with firefox or curl.



📊 5. System Monitor (GNOME System Monitor / KSysGuard)
GUI Action: Viewing running processes or killing tasks from the graphical monitor.

What’s running behind the scenes:

bash
Copy
Edit
top                             # show live running processes
ps aux                          # show list of processes
kill <PID>                      # terminate a process
htop                            # advanced view of processes
The GUI view of your system activity is powered by real-time output from top, ps, and kill commands.
